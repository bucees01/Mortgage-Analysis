# Mortgage-Analysis

Our machine learning model predicts the probability of whether an individual with certain characteristics (income, location, ethnicity, etc) will get accepted for a mortgage or not. It also provides an estimate for the interest rate that the individual will pay on their mortgage if accepted for it.


Additionally, we have an interactive app that prompts a user to input their information and displays the probability that their loan will be accepted and what their interest rate will approximately be based on their inputs.
